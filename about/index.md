# About the blog

![Per Lundberg](/images/perlun.png)

This blog is being run by Per Lundberg. The blog engine being used is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which I can recommend to others as well; it's very easy to get started with and it generates a _static site_ which can be deployed to any webserver, any hosting etc.

If you like, you can also reach me in the following ways.
