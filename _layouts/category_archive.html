<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
  It should come as no big surprise if you've been reading this blog that
  a big passion in my life is <em>programming</em>. It has been a hobby
  of mine since sometime in the nineties (probably 1994, 95 or sometime
  around this - my oldest "proof" of something I wrote is the small BBS
  intro <code>flower.com</code> which is dated September 1996) and my
  primary way to make my living since 1999, with very few exceptions.
</p>

<p>
  During these years, I've produced a number of different projects on my spare
  time, of various size and grade of "seriosity". Here is a list of some of
  these projects. I'm hoping to add more links to this list over time, adding
  binaries and sometimes the source code (in the cases where it hasn't gotten
  lost over the years.) Many have been solo projects, others have been
  cooperative projects with my brother Johannes Ridderstedt, who has been an
  <em>invaluable</em> source of help and inspiration when learning about
  computer hardware, software and programming. This list wouldn't be what
  it is without him - <em>thanks bro</em>, I owe you a lot! :heart:

<ul>
  <li>1996: flower.com (BBS intro, written in x86 assembly for MS-DOS.)</li>
