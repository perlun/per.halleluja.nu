<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
  It should come as no big surprise if you've been reading this blog that
  a big passion in my life is <em>programming</em>. It has been a hobby
  of mine since sometime in the nineties (probably 1994, 95 or sometime
  around this - my oldest "proof" of something I wrote is the small BBS
  intro <code>flower.com</code> which is dated September 1996) and my
  primary way to make my living since 1999, with very few exceptions.
</p>

<p>
  During these years, I've produced a number of different projects on my spare
  time, of various size and grade of "seriosity". Here is a list of some of
  these projects. I'm hoping to add more links to this list over time, adding
  binaries and sometimes the source code (in the cases where it hasn't gotten
  lost over the years.) Many have been solo projects, others have been
  cooperative projects with my brother Johannes Ridderstedt, who has been an
  <em>invaluable</em> source of help and inspiration when learning about
  computer hardware, software and programming. This list wouldn't be what
  it is without him - <em>thanks bro</em>, I owe you a lot! :heart:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>1996: flower.com (BBS intro, written in x86 assembly for MS-DOS.)</li>
  <li>1997: <a href="gameland">Gameland intro</a> (original probably in C, for
    MS-DOS. See further down for intro about the later rewrite.
  <li>1998: rot13 TSR (x86 assembly for MS-DOS)</li>
  <li>1999: Cybermario, an unfinished Mario-spinoff game (C++ for MS-DOS)</li>
  <li>1999: Tribes, an unfinished Civilization clone (C, targetting GTK/Linux)</li>
  <li>1999: <a href="http://chaosdev.io">chaos</a>, an operating system
    (C &amp; x86 assembly)</li>
  <li>2004: iZ, a CMS written using PHP &amp; MySQL</li>
  <li>2008: <a href="https://github.com/perlun/cocos">cocos</a>, a simple
    operating system-like toy for x86-64. (C &amp; x86 assembly)</li>
  <li>2013: <a href="https://github.com/perlun/billigastematkassen">Billigaste
    Matkassen</a>, a shopping price analyzing helper. Web app written using 
    JavaScript &amp; jQuery with backend in Ruby, using Redis as data store.</li>
  <li>2013: Imported the chaos source code to
    <a href="https://github.com/chaos4ever/chaos">GitHub</a> and started
    looking into making it compile &amp; run again on modern <code>gcc</code>
    versions. A lot of the existing functionality is now working again as of
    2018.</li>
  <li>2018: <a href="gameland">Gameland rewrite</a>, this time in Rust,
    targetting WebAssembly</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Books that I would like to read</h2>
<p>
  (Unsurprisingly, this is my personal "wishlist" of books so I remember what to ask from others/buy for myself. :-)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>. This book was recommended to me by a good friend named
      Andreas Finne. He praised it greatly, saying that "if you understand what is written in it, you will become a better
      programmer". I want to grow and learn more, so this is definitely one of the books I would like to read at some point.
    </p>
    
    <p>The book is available for reading online <a href="https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml">here</a></p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>
      <em><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/The-Art-of-Multiprocessor-Programming--Revised-Reprint/9780123973375">The
        Art of Multiprocessor Programming - Maurice Herlihy, Nir Shavit</a></em>. Parallel programming is something I find
      fascinating, and even though I've been doing it a bit in the past, I know that there is _a lot_ to learn, particularly in
      areas like <em>lock-free concurrency</em> and the general theory behind implementing traditional (locking-based) concurrency
      primitives. Since I've never studied CS, I feel there are a lot of areas here where I could improve.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      (After writing the above, I have purchased the book and started looking into it but it's really not a very easy book to
      read; it's quite demanding on the reader. I anticipate it will take a year or two before I'm through this. It's definitely
      not something that's easy to just pick up and read during your lunch break or similar.)

<h2>Links that I find interesting</h2>
<p>
  Yes, this is sort of my personal collection of "bookmarks" that I intend to read some day. :)
