## Gameland intro
### Background

My nice brother Johannes Ridderstedt sent me some old files a few weeks ago
(in late 2017), stuff that he had preserved from an age-old computer of ours.

One of these was the file named `gameland.zip` (not published yet, but I might
put it up here some day.) I managed to get this running, and liked what I saw
(you'll find the YouTube link to it further down on this page.)

### Rewriting it in Rust for WebAssembly

Around this time I was reading a bit about [WebAssembly](WebAssembly) which I
think will redefine and help reshape the web as we see it today. I was also
looking at the [Hello, Rust](https://www.hellorust.com) web page, and the ["FizzleFade effect using a Feistel network"](https://www.hellorust.com/demos/feistel/index.html)
page in particular.

I didn't look at the Feistel network code; instead, I was much more interested
in learning about how to draw 2D graphics to a canvas, which this demo was
doing. _Maybe I could reinvent some of my old, cool stuff using new, modern
technology_? And perhaps learn something new in the process of doing so? I
started playing around with this, and spent maybe 5 evenings or so, a little
time here and there trying to get some progress on various areas.

Here is the result:

<input type="image" src="gameland.png" alt="Gameland" id="run-wasm">

Click on the image above to start the demo (it will switch to fullscreen.) Only
tested in Firefox, Chrome and Safari on desktop; the full-screen stuff isn't
fully standardized yet so it uses prefixed, vendor-specific JavaScript calls.

<canvas id="screen" width="320" height="200" style="border: black 1px solid; display: none;"></canvas>

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/perlun/gameland-wasm) if
you are interested in the full details on how it works.

**Update 2018-03-16**: I made some adjustments to make it closer to the
original; faster scrolling, more blinking. I also considered switching to [chiptune2](https://github.com/deskjet/chiptune2.js)
as the `.mod` player but after implementing the change I benchmarked the two
versions and concluded that the CPU usage was basically the same, so it wasn't
quite worth it. `libopenmpt` (the C library used by chiptune2.js under the
hood) has arguably a higher quality mixing code, but my usage of it is not
100% working so... I'm leaving it like this for now.

### The old version

Finally, for reference, here is the output from running the original intro and
the comments I wrote about it on YouTube.
