Today, a big change was launched on this blog. Meet, for the first time in years actually, an _English_ version of the blog. At the same time, the branding and URL is also changed from http://per.halleluja.nu to http://perlun.tk. The previous name also works, but the latter part is the new, official name of the blog.

One of the reasons for adding English as a language for the blog is that I will start writing a bit more about various geek/technology things I find interesting, and for such topics, I find English a better, more natural language to use when writing (not to mention the potential audience is somewhat larger...).

I will probably _not_ write everything on the blog in both languages (Swedish and English); more likely, I will write about some stuff in Swedish when I feel like it, and other stuff in English when I find that to be more natural.

As for the branding, I felt I wanted to split things out a bit so that http://halleluja.nu is one site (which I am also the author of) and this blog is another site, with different host names. I don't want people to reject my blog posts about technology just because they happen to dislike the faith of Jesus Christ or anything similarly silly.
