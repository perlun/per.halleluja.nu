Today, a big change was launched on this blog. Meet, for the first time in years actually, an _English_ version of the blog. At the same time, the branding and URL is also changed from http://per.halleluja.nu to ~~http://perlun.tk~~ http://perlun.eu.org. The previous name also works, but the latter part is the new, official name of the blog.

(**Update**: I originally went with the `.tk` name, but after reading that some people had very bad experiences with their `.tk` domain names being "taken away" by Dot.tk, I settled with something more stable and reliable.)

One of the reasons for adding English as a language for the blog is that I will start writing a bit more about various geek/technology things I find interesting, and for such topics, I find English a better, more natural language to use when writing (not to mention the potential audience is somewhat larger...). To be honest, I would even find it _strange_ to write about these things in Swedish, probably because you more or less "think" in English when doing geeky stuff.

I will probably _not_ write everything on the blog in both languages (Swedish and English); more likely, I will write about some stuff in Swedish when I feel like it, and other stuff in English when I find that to be more natural.

As for the branding, I felt I wanted to split things out a bit so that http://halleluja.nu is one site (which I am also the author of) and this blog is another site, with different host names. I am in no way ashamed of my other writings or anything. At the same time, I don't want people to reject my blog posts about technology just because they happen to dislike my faith in Jesus Christ. So, I just want to separate things a bit. Anyone _reading_ this blog (especially the Swedish posts) will quite clearly notice that I am a believer anyway, it's a very poorly kept secret...
