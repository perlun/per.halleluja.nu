This is a post where I summarize some of the projects I have been hacking on during 2020. Note that only "non-work" related projects are covered by this list. FOSS projects which I have been able to contribute to during work time are included, though.

(The text below is an excerpt from my general page about programming which can be found [here](/en/programming).)
