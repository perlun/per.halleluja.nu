title:  "More memory leaks: JVM and JRuby"
categories:
- programming
---

The casual reader can get the impression that I do nothing else right now than debug memory leaks. This is luckily quite far from the truth. :smile: It just happens to be that I haven't had the chance to write about other things recently.

(The above is a reference to [this post](http://perlun.eu.org/en/2017/08/24/debugging-hard-to-reproduce-ruby-memory-leaks) which was written a while ago. The preconditions there are different there though, and the root cause is also different.)

We have an app running on JRuby and JVM, which is leaking a lot of memory. It has to be restarted with a few days intervals. The app was previously running on Windows, but was recently moved to Linux. Previously, the server was scheduled to reboot every night, which "worked around" the memory leaks in a very silly and stupid (but working!) way.

Now, with the new setup, there are no such scheduled reboots any more, and so, the application is running out of memory.

The app was restarted yesterday. Right now, this is the memory usage:

```
root@microservice-jruby-xxxxxxxxxx:/# ps -ax -o pid,rss | grep 9762
 9762 2451060
```

As a first step, I activated `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC` in `JAVA_OPTS`, which doesn't help the memory leak per se but makes sense on this environment anyway.

Then I Installed the `openjdk-8-jdk-headless` Debian package to get the `jmap` tool, which is useful for gathering heap dumps.

## Re-learning how to create a heap dump

I have been making heap dumps before, but only on Windows. I tried now to make a dump on this Linux machine, but failed. It first complained about non-aligned memory address (might have been because JRE version was upgraded when I installed the `openjdk-8-jdk-headless` package, so restarted the process), then complained about this:

```

I started googling and found [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33733445/java-heap-dump-error-metadata-does-not-appear-to-be-polymorphic) which helped me. Of course, I was running it as the wrong user which caused this issue...

To solve the problem, I re-ran the command like this: `sudo -u ecraft jmap -dump:format=b,file=/tmp/heapdump-20170926-0901 7410`, which worked flawlessly. Then I transferred the file to my local computer (with `scp`), and ran `jvisualvm`. Unfortunately, it refused to open the file. It turned out `jvisualvm` can only use a full _core dump_, not a heap dump...

So I tried with `jhat` instead. Worked much better, now all I had to do was learn yet another new tool. :wink: I also learned that `kill -3 <pid>` can give you a core dump, but only if specifically instructed to do so. By default, it prints some pretty interesting information to `stdout` or `stderr` (a list of all current threads, and some heap data). It looked like this in my case (non-comprehensive form):

Remember, this was now a short period of time after the Java process was started. Here is what the memory usage looked like:

```
root@microservice-jruby-xxxxxxxxxx:/# ps -ax -o pid,rss | grep 14302
14302 552424
 ```

I then gave it some time to run, and got back to see how it was doing. I also discussed with a colleague and heard that Eclipse Memory Analyzer is a quite decent tool for debugging these issues (it was also mentioned in one of the blog posts linked below.)

This is what it looked like after a few days:

```
root@microservice-jruby-m3prdes201:/# ps -ax -o pid,rss | grep 14302
14302 2297204
```

It _feels_ like a leak, but more analysis is needed before we know for sure. I took out the `SIGQUIT` (`kill -3`) data again, and made a heap dump as well:

We were now close to the weekend, so we restarted preventively.

## Using Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool to further dig into the issue

Then, I opened the heap dump in MAT a few days later. Since the heap dump was 2 GiB this time, it took a bit of time for MAT to open and analyze it. Unfortunately, it eventually ran into an error:

![GC overhead limit exceeded](/images/2017-09-26-memory-memory-leaks-jvm-and-jruby-gc-overhead-limit-exceeded.png)

By googling I found [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19570209/how-to-fix-this-error-gc-overhead-limit-exceeded-in-eclipse), which led me to tweak `MemoryAnalyzer.ini` like below, and then restart MAT and reopen the file. (The default was to max out at 1024 MiB, which was obviously too little to be able to load a file of this size.)

```
-startup
../Eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.100.v20150511-1540.jar
--launcher.library
../Eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.cocoa.macosx.x86_64_1.1.300.v20150602-1417
-vmargs
-Xms1024m
-Xmx4096m
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts
-XstartOnFirstThread
```

It actually felt a bit faster this time, perhaps because the JVM now had a bigger maximum heap size to play with.

When the file was done opening, I went straight to the "leak suspects report". Maybe it would give me a hint of the right direction?

## jruby.org.MetaClass: our prime suspect

![Problem suspect 1](/images/2017-09-26-memory-memory-leaks-jvm-and-jruby-problem-suspect-1.png)

One _gigabyte_ of [MetaClass](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/jruby/MetaClass.java) instances, that's quite a lot indeed. Metaclass does not seem to be a very big and complex class itself, but its parent class is [RubyClass](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/jruby/RubyClass.java) which is a much longer class.

Then I looked at the histogram:

![Histogram of heap usage per class](/images/2017-09-26-memory-memory-leaks-jvm-and-jruby-histogram.png)

The histogram above also shows the same picture basically. 40 000 Ruby MetaClass instances, with a total of 468 000 IR methods. What are these methods, more specifically? I mean - if I group these methods by name, _what names are the most common ones_? Let's try and find that out!

In the process of doing this, I learned that Eclipse MAT has an interesting thing called the OQL (Object Query Language?), which is essentially an SQL-like language which you can use to query the heap dump for data. Very interesting indeed! Unfortunately, I didn't yet manage to do any `GROUP BY` queries with it, which would super cool since I could then see more specifically what _methods_ are most commonly being defined.

Here was one of my initial OQL queries by the way:

```sql
SELECT realClass.baseName.toString() FROM org.jruby.MetaClass
```

I found out that there was a way to workaround this: by exporting the results to CSV, I could then just pipe it via some neat Unix utilities and get a grouped view:

```shell
$ cat meta_class_base_names.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
37852 Logger,
2527 Class,
 436 Module,
 239 PatternFormatter,
 133 ConnectionOptions,
  36 JavaPackage,
  11 Function,
   5 Object,
   5 ExternalRuntime,
   5 Cell,
   1 realClass.baseName.toString(),
   1 ThreadedConnectionPool,
   1 String,
   1 StdoutOutputter,
   1 RootLogger,
   1 Resources,
   1 Resolv,
   1 Proc,
   1 Hash,
   1 FeatureFlag,
   1 Database,
   1 Cors,
   1 Configuration,
   1 Command,
   1 Array,
```

Almost _40000_ `Logger` classes. That's clearly not reasonable. The number of `Class` instances is high, perhaps even to the point of unreasonable, but there's more than 10 times more Logger classes, so let's focus on these for starters.

## Finding the root cause and final conclusions

The obvious next question then is, of course: _why do we have such an enormous amount of Logger classes being defined_? I looked more in [the JRuby source code](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/jruby/RubyModule.java#L536-L546) and found out that the `cachedName` property would probably give us an even better name. Let's re-run the query above like this:

```sql
SELECT realClass.cachedName.toString() FROM org.jruby.MetaClass
```

```shell
$ cat real_class_cached_name.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
37852 Log4r::Logger,
2527 Class,
 436 Module,
 239 Log4r::PatternFormatter,
 133 Faraday::ConnectionOptions,
  36 Java::JavaPackage,
  11 FFI::Function,
   5 Object,
   5 ExecJS::ExternalRuntime,
   5 Celluloid::Proxy::Cell,
   1 realClass.cachedName.toString(),
   1 String,
   1 Sequel::ThreadedConnectionPool,
   1 Sequel::JDBC::Database,
   1 Resolv,
   1 Rack::Cors::Resources,
   1 Rack::Cors,
   1 Proc,
   1 Log4r::StdoutOutputter,
   1 Log4r::RootLogger,
   1 Hash,
   1 Celluloid::Supervision::Configuration,
   1 Bundler::Thor::Command,
   1 Bundler::FeatureFlag,
   1 Array,
```

Alright - I think we have the root cause found here. [log4r](https://github.com/colbygk/log4r) seems to be used in our application and/or framework in such a way that it creates a huge number of classes, eventually bringing the system down on its knees.

But this was strange. I know that we did, a few months ago, move away from `log4r` to use our home-weaved [logging_library](https://github.com/ecraft/logging_library) instead. It does _not_ use `log4r` under the hood, since `log4r` is more-or-less abandoned upstream. I digged into the `Gemfile.lock` of my application and looked to see where the `log4r` dependency was coming from.

Ah. I see it now... This application uses a somewhat _older_ version of the application server, where we hadn't yet gotten rid of `log4r`. :smile: There is actually an open pull request to upgrade it, we just haven't had time to test that thoroughly enough to be able to ship it to the customer. So, we will focus on getting that PR merged and deployed now ASAP, and check if that makes the leak go away permanently. If not, I will undoubtedly let you know...

As always, thanks for reading! I hope it helped you get ideas and inspiration for when you have to debug similar issues yourself.
